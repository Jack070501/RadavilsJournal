    <h1>Dream Log</h1>
    <h2>The Familiar Land</h2>
    <p>
        It was at dusk that I collapsed into my linens, exhausted from a 
        long eve of performance. I took a long draw on my pipe and was swiftly 
        guided into a blissful slumber. As quickly as I had settled, I stirred 
        in a familiar land, rubbing the slumber from my eyes. I walked down the 
        earthen path, dodging nettles and swinging past vast oak trunks. 
        The smell of spring stole my breath as I trod the same beaten track 
        I had walked countless times before. I could have walked for hours, 
        but the euphoric buzz of the leaf transported me swiftly to my destination: 
        the cliffside where I had spent many nights, gazing across the beautiful 
        horizon. Stars often shot across the nights sky, and elevated as the cliff 
        was, it afforded a prolonged view of such cosmic wonders.

        Pervil and Lark were already at the cliffs edge, waiting patiently for my 
        arrival. "Good tidings Radas" Lark greeted me as I sank next to them. We 
        passed around our pipes for a while,  sampling rare strains and sharing 
        observations about flavours and undertones. After some time had passed, Lark 
        suggested "Let us walk on", clambering to his feet. Pervil and I lingered 
        behind, telling tales of previous exploits. Lark would interject with quips 
        and jokes, but he seemed determined to press on around the cliffs edge, I 
        had guessed he was eager to show us something. Still laughing and smoking, 
        Pervil and I closed on Lark at a narrowing of the edge. "Not far now, just 
        over this outcropping." We clambered over roots and mud, to come into a small 
        clearing of cozy wildflowers. It was an elegant find, perfect for crafting 
        a small fire to sit around for warmth and storytelling. The familiar sleepy 
        buzz of the leaf was taking hold, and the night was growing darker, so it 
        was agreed we'd gather the necessary materials to create a camp.

        Pervil paced back through mud, dizzied by our herbal affliction. He slid 
        precariously and clawed at mud, letting out a whispered yelp. Lark, the most 
        lucid of us, darted across the clearing and pulled Pervil to his feet.  "I 
        shall get the firewood" he sighed, as he pushed Pervil back into the clearing. 
        As he took a confident stride over the mud, a root caught his ankle, throwing 
        him to the edge. Again, mud was clawed desperately, as he began to slide. 
        The ground did not afford Lark the same grip, instead gathering under his 
        nails. The rocks far below raced up to Lark, as he let out a guttural scream. 
        A thud. Bones snapped and blood splattered.
