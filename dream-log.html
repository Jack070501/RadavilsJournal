    <h1>Dream Log</h1>
    <h2>The Familiar Land</h2>
    <p>
        It was at dusk that I collapsed into my linens, exhausted from a 
        long eve of performance. I took a long draw on my pipe and was swiftly 
        guided into a blissful slumber. As quickly as I had settled, I stirred 
        in a familiar land, rubbing the slumber from my eyes. I walked down the 
        earthen path, dodging nettles and swinging past vast oak trunks. 
        The smell of spring stole my breath as I trod the same beaten track 
        I had walked countless times before. I could have walked for hours, 
        but the euphoric buzz of the leaf transported me swiftly to my destination: 
        the cliffside where I had spent many nights, gazing across the beautiful 
        horizon. Stars often shot across the nights sky, and elevated as the cliff 
        was, it afforded a prolonged view of such cosmic wonders.
    </p>
    <p>
        Pervil and Lark were already at the cliffs edge, waiting patiently for my 
        arrival. "Good tidings Radas" Lark greeted me as I sank next to them. We 
        passed around our pipes for a while,  sampling rare strains and sharing 
        observations about flavours and undertones. After some time had passed, Lark 
        suggested "Let us walk on", clambering to his feet. Pervil and I lingered 
        behind, telling tales of previous exploits. Lark would interject with quips 
        and jokes, but he seemed determined to press on around the cliffs edge, I 
        had guessed he was eager to show us something. Still laughing and smoking, 
        Pervil and I closed on Lark at a narrowing of the edge. "Not far now, just 
        over this outcropping." We clambered over roots and mud, to come into a small 
        clearing of cozy wildflowers. It was an elegant find, perfect for crafting 
        a small fire to sit around for warmth and storytelling. The familiar sleepy 
        buzz of the leaf was taking hold, and the night was growing darker, so it 
        was agreed we'd gather the necessary materials to create a camp.
    </p>
    <p>
        Pervil paced back through mud, dizzied by our herbal affliction. He slid 
        precariously and clawed at mud, letting out a whispered yelp. Lark, the most 
        lucid of us, darted across the clearing and pulled Pervil to his feet.  "I 
        shall get the firewood" he sighed, as he pushed Pervil back into the clearing. 
        As he took a confident stride over the mud, a root caught his ankle, throwing 
        him to the edge. Again, mud was clawed desperately, as he began to slide. 
        The ground did not afford Lark the same grip, instead gathering under his 
        nails. The rocks far below raced up to Lark, as he let out a guttural scream. 
        A thud. Bones snapped and blood splattered.
    </p>
    <p>
        I was jerked violently awake, no longer comforted by the buzz of the leaf. 
        My heart pounded into my throat, but I was back again, in the familiar lands. 
        I gathered my composure and made off again down the beaten track. I had encountered 
        bad dreams before, and resolved to forget about my mishap. Step after step fell 
        on hard earth, and sharp air filled my lungs. I was acutely aware of my surroundings, 
        and of myself. The numbness of the dreamscape had given way to cold, rigid senses. 
        I looked back at my progress, and with frustration, discovered I had made little. 
        I pressed on, determined to find Pervil and Lark, and resume my pleasant night. 
        Again I looked back, frustrated at my lack of progress. This continued for hours. 
        As I reached the end of my spirits, my stomach groaned with pain, and my eyes 
        stung with the anticipation of tears. Finally I stumbled, exhausted, yet still 
        agonisingly aware, onto the cliffside.
    </p>
    <p>
        Pervil and Lark stood gormless at the cliffs edge, staring at beautiful cosmic 
        displays. Their empty eyes reflected colourful lights, their illusion, lost on 
        them. "Good tidings" I croaked. "Good tidings I say." I was left wholly ignored. 
        The cliff sat silent. "Gentlemen? Please." Lark finally raised. He did not turn 
        to greet me. "Lark?" Lark sprinted to the edge. Over he went, his rigid body. A 
        thud. Bones snapped and blood splattered.
    </p>
    <p>
        A guttural scream woke me up, this time my own. I choked on the sharp night air, gasping. I was back in my bed, thoroughly awake. The nights events had left me shaken, and good dreams where an unlikely prospect. Thus, I left my hovel, and made for the graveyard, to find my friends. The grave keeper Viktor, and grave owner Billy were reliably awake. I surmised enviously that Grub must be enjoying the embraces of slumber. I was welcomed stoically, yet amicably as they went about their duties. I perched myself on a grave and brought out my pipe, ready to smoke away the nights worries.
    </p>
    <p>
        As the comforting buzz set upon me, and Victors rhythmic shovel struck the earth, I began to slip into consciousness. I half stirred in my bed. This realisation jolted me back into the graveyard. Amused, I realised, I was still dreaming. A smile spread across me as I realised that the graveyard was my familiar land, to retreat to when life required refuge. The night had outstayed its welcome, and eager to return to the comfort of my linens, I pinched myself. To my surprise I did not wake. I cursed and tried again, but again I did not wake.
    </p>
    <p>
        The graveyard grew eerily silent as Viktor and Billy shot me empty glances. Their gormless expressions frightened me immensely, so that I shook and hit myself. Only pain followed, I could not stir. As I looked up frantically, I realised I had lost Viktor and Billy, leaving me profoundly alone. I stood there for some time pleading the night to end. Eventually, I gave up on my pleading, and resigned myself to explore the graveyard; perhaps my exit would let itself be know. As I skulked between shallow graves and stumbled through mud, I heard whispering from behind a tomb. I sneaked closer to press my ear around the corner. Billy and Viktor mumbled feverishly, and although I could not hear, I could sense sinister intentions. I peeked my head around so that I could discern their conspiracies, but was interrupted by a horrifying whisper. "He knows." They both turned to face me, their expressions empty.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now I was the one hiding, running past tombstones and into the wooden toolshack. A deep melancholy set upon me and evilness swelled in my stomach. I must admit, I was powerless to hold back tears, as I spent an eternity hiding in that shed, listening to the Thud,Thud,Thud, of victors shovel. I was jolted back to the present by a Clang. The sounds of immense stone being shifted echoed through the shack, followed by the scurrying of footsteps, that slowly faded into the distance. After quite some time, I built up what little courage I had left and peered out of my fragile shack.
    </p>
    <p>
        Viktors digging had given way to a wide pit, evidently covered by two large stone slabs, which had been shifted aside. In this pit, a stone staircase led down into dark, unseen depths. I creeped over to the stairs, obsessively scanning my surroundings. Could this be my exit? Or was this another horror waiting to attack my fragile constitution. As I pondered this thought, my answer was given to me. I was thrown down the stairs violently, scarcely reaching the bottom before the stone cover shifted again, drowning me in darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
        My weak cries echoed throughout the chamber as unknown horrors closed in on me. I pushed myself into a corner and failed to strike a match, splitting it in two. I fumbled for another match and this time was successful. What it illuminated filled the chamber with my horrified screams. A large glob of human viscera slimed slowly towards me. The gelatinous monster was an amalgamation of random limbs, teeth, and tufts of hair, all slopped into one semi-liquid form. I watched in horror as it pressed me into the corner, before again being plunged into darkness. I struck another match, to find it had gained on me. I clawed at the dirt, climbing up the wall, as it groaned and creeped onto me. My legs were plunged first into its hideous depths, warm and pungent. It enveloped my torso and pulled me in, drowning me with my own screams.
    </p>
    <p>
        Yet again, I jolted awake. Again, in the familiar lands. I screamed and pounded the floor, begging for the end. I crawled into a ball and sobbed, resolute to wait there for death. I did not wait long, a beast of human form, but ape-like features crashed through the trees at the other end of the path. I found in that moment that I had not yet accepted death, or maybe ran from it out of fear. It chased me, swinging between great oak stumps. Screaming, it chased me all the way to the cliffs edge, before fading into the distance. I was greeted, again, by two figures. However, this time, a young ape, holding a Childs hand.
    </p>
    <p>
        They stared at the beautiful nights sky, watching shooting stars and cosmic displays of colour. I did not call out to them, but approached, and stood beside them. Together we looked out, staring at the cosmos. Our eyes filled with explosions of light, in a horrific display of wonder. Indescribable images, magnificent and horrible, filled our minds. I broke my gaze, and saw the child and ape, get pulled above the cliff, suspended. Their eyes gushed light and their skin began to peel, then sloughed, from their bodies. "Please," they screamed "please!" They stared at the cosmos, and it stared back at them, grinning. I threw myself off the cliff. Thud.
