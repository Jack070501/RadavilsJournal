        <h1>About this project</h1>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>This project is to help me brush up on my basic javascript,html and css skills to consolidate any learning I have done in the past couple of years. It will be a playground for me to try different ideas and different ways of developing funtionality.</p>
            <p>I have used vanilla javascript for this project and have mostly created all of the content myself, although AI generated conent has been used sparingly.</p>
        <h2>Features worked on in this project</h2>
            <h3>Theme switcher</h3>
                <p>I have added a light and dark mode to the site set by the users preferences. The user can change this with the toggle in the navigation menu.</p>
