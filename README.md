# A vanilla javascript website
## Overview
This project is to help me brush up on my basic javascript,html and css skills to consolidate any learning I have done in the past couple of years. It will be a playground for me to try different ideas and different ways of developing funtionality.
## Radavils Journal
As I needed some content to fill out my website (and I am determined to use as little AI generated content as possible,) I have chosen to make a website aimed at my D&D group, with lots of inside jokes and player lore. Therefore, if you choose to read some of the contents, please read them in the light hearted tone they were written.
