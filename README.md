# A vanilla javascript website
## Overview
The intention of this project is to help me brush up on my basic JavaScript, HTML and CSS skills to consolidate any learning I have done in the past year. It will be a playground for me to try different ideas and different ways of developing functionality.

As I needed some content to fill out my website (and I am determined to use as little AI generated content as possible), I have chosen to create a website aimed at my D&D group, with lots of inside jokes and player lore. Therefore, if you choose to read some of the content, please do so in the light hearted tone in which it was written.
